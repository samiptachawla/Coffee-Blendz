        <h2>Origin and Details</h2>
        <p>Turkish coffee is a traditional method of brewing coffee that originated in Turkey. It is known for its rich flavor, strong aroma, and thick consistency. Turkish coffee is prepared using very finely ground coffee beans and is typically served unfiltered, resulting in a unique and intense coffee experience.</p>
        
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Measure the water and coffee grounds. For one cup of Turkish coffee, use one cup of cold water and one heaping teaspoon of finely ground Turkish coffee.</li>
            <li>Combine the water and coffee grounds in a cezve (Turkish coffee pot).</li>
            <li>Heat the cezve over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the coffee begins to foam and rise.</li>

            <li>Pour the coffee into cups, making sure to distribute the foam evenly.</li>
